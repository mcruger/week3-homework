<h2>Welcome.</h2>
Here are the rules:
<ul>
	<li>Roll the dice to start the game.</li>
	<li>If your first roll is a 7 or 11, you win.</li>
	<li>If your first roll is a 2, 3, or 12, you lose.</li>
	<li>Anything else becomes your <i>goal.</i> Roll your goal again before rolling a 7, and you win. Roll a 7 instead of your goal, and you lose.</li>
